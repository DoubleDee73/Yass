<h2>Import Melody</h2>

You can create your own karaoke version for a given MP3 file. 
<p>
Finding correct tones is the hardest task. 
The process is much easier if you can extract the melody 
from a matching KAR file. 
<p>
A KAR is a specific MIDI file with synchronized lyrics. 
If you only have a MIDI file, you can still extract the
melody, but have to synchronize the songtext to the music 
on your own. 
<p>
Please choose a KAR or MIDI file.
