<h2>Finetuning</h2>

Your song file is about to be created. You can then proceed as follows.
<ol>
<li>Approximate notes: You can quickly record position and length by tapping to the music.
<li>Finetune them: Each note must be checked and corrected manually.
</ol>
Finetuning takes about 2-3 hours for an expert. 
Be patient: you will learn how to hear correct note lengths and tones.
<p>
Have fun!
